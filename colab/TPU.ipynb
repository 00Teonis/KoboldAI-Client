        "KoboldAI is a powerful and easy way to use a variety of AI based text generation experiences. You can use it to write stories, blog posts, play a text adventure game, use it like a chatbot and more! In some cases it might even help you with an assignment or programming task (But always make sure the information the AI mentions is correct, it loves to make stuff up).\n",

        "1. On a phone? First put your browser in desktop mode because of a Google Colab bug. Otherwise nothing will happen when you click the play button. Then tap the play button next to \"<-- Tap This if you play on Mobile\", you will see an audio player. Keep the audio player playing so Colab does not get shut down in the background.\n",
        "2. Select the desired model, you will find a description of all the available models further down the page.\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<-- Select your model below and then click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Got a message saying no accelerator is available? Click cancel, and try again in a few minutes. If you do not manage to get a session when you frequently try again try at a different time of day, colab can be busy or your priority may have been lowered by frequent usage.\n",
        "5. After everything is done loading you will get a link that you can use to open KoboldAI. In case of Localtunnel you will also be warned that some people are abusing Localtunnel for phishing, once you acknowledge this warning you will be taken to KoboldAI's interface. If you picked Cloudflare and get a 1033 error refresh the error page after waiting one minute.\n",

        "Make sure to keep this page open while you are using KoboldAI, and check back regularly to see if you got a Captcha. Failure to complete the captcha's in time can result in termination of your session or a lower priority towards the TPUs."

This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |\n",

On top of that it also consists of light novel training further expanding its knowledge and writing capabilities. It can be used with the You filter bias if you wish to write Novels with it, but dedicated Novel models can perform better for this task. |\n",

It is exclusively for Adventure Mode and can take you on the epic and wackey adventures that AI Dungeon players love. It also features the many tropes of AI Dungeon as it has been trained on very similar data. It must be used in second person (You). |\n",

Creating a high quality model for your NSFW stories. This model is exclusively a novel model and is best used in third person. |\n",
        "| Convo | 6B | Chatbot | Convo-6B is a GPT-J 6B model fine-tuned on a collection of high quality open source datasets which amount to 6 million messages. The primary goal of the model is to provide improved performance and generalization when generating multi-turn dialogue for characters that were not present from within the fine tuning data. The prompted performance has especially improved over the predecessor model [C1-6B](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/c1-6B). |\n",

Its behavior will be similar to the GPT-J-6B model since they are trained on the same dataset but with more sensitivity towards repetition penalty and with more knowledge. |\n",
        "| Fairseq Dense | 13B | Generic | Trained by Facebook Researchers this model stems from the MOE research project within Fairseq. This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger 20B model from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. |\n",

You will likely get better result with larger generic models or finetuned models. |\n",

        "| Adventure | These models are excellent for people willing to play KoboldAI like a Text Adventure game and are meant to be used with Adventure mode enabled. Even if you wish to use it as a Novel style model you should always have Adventure mode on and set it to story. These models typically have a strong bias towards the use of the word You and without Adventure mode enabled break the story flow and write actions on your behalf. |\n",

They can do everything the other models can do, but require much more handholding to work properly. Generic models are an ideal basis for tasks that we have no specific model for, or for experiencing a softprompt in its raw form. |\n",

        "-  Google will occationally show a Captcha, typically after it has been open for 30 minutes but it can be more frequent if you often use Colab. Make sure to do these properly, or you risk getting your instance shut down and getting a lower priority towards the TPU's.\n",
        "- KoboldAI uses Google Drive to store your files and settings, if you wish to upload a softprompt or userscript this can be done directly on the Google Drive website. You can also use this to download backups of your KoboldAI related files or upload models of your own.\n",
        "- Don't want to save your stories on Google Drive for privacy reasons? Do not use KoboldAI's save function and instead click Download as .json, this will automatically download the story to your own computer without ever touching Google's harddrives. You can load this back trough the Load from file option.\n",
        "- Google shut your instance down unexpectedly? You can still make use of the Download as .json button to recover your story as long as you did not close the KoboldAI window. You can then load this back up in your next session.\n",
        "- Done with KoboldAI? Go to the Runtime menu, click on Manage Sessions and terminate your open sessions that you no longer need. This trick can help you maintain higher priority towards getting a TPU.\n",
        "- Models stored on Google Drive typically load faster than models we need to download from the internet."
