This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |\n",

        "| Skein by VE\\_FORBRYDERNE | 6B | Adventure | Skein is best used with Adventure mode enabled, it consists of a 4 times larger adventure dataset than the Adventure model making it excellent for text adventure gaming. On top of that it also consists of light novel training further expanding its knowledge and writing capabilities. It can be used with the You filter bias if you wish to write Novels with it, but dedicated Novel models can perform better for this task. |\n",

It is exclusively for Adventure Mode and can take you on the epic and wackey adventures that AI Dungeon players love. It also features the many tropes of AI Dungeon as it has been trained on very similar data. It must be used in second person (You). |\n",
        "| Lit by Haru | 6B | NSFW | Lit is a great NSFW model trained by Haru on both a large set of Literotica stories and high quality novels along with tagging support. Creating a high quality model for your NSFW stories. This model is exclusively a novel model and is best used in third person. |\n",
        "| Convo | 6B | Chatbot | Convo-6B is a GPT-J 6B model fine-tuned on a collection of high quality open source datasets which amount to 6 million messages. The primary goal of the model is to provide improved performance and generalization when generating multi-turn dialogue for characters that were not present from within the fine tuning data. The prompted performance has especially improved over the predecessor model [C1-6B](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/c1-6B). |\n",

        "| Neo(X) by EleutherAI | 20B | Generic | NeoX is the largest EleutherAI model currently available, being a generic model it is not particularly trained towards anything and can do a variety of writing, Q&A and coding tasks. 20B's performance is closely compared to the 13B models and it is worth trying both especially if you have a task that does not involve english writing. Its behavior will be similar to the GPT-J-6B model since they are trained on the same dataset but with more sensitivity towards repetition penalty and with more knowledge. |\n",
        "| Fairseq Dense | 13B | Generic | Trained by Facebook Researchers this model stems from the MOE research project within Fairseq. This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger 20B model from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. |\n",

Being trained on the Pile and not biased towards anything in particular it is suitable for a variety of tasks such as writing, Q&A and coding tasks. You will likely get better result with larger generic models or finetuned models. |\n",

        "4. Allow Google Drive access, this typically happens trough a popup but sometimes Google Drive access may be requested trough the older method by asking you to click on a link and copy a code. This is normal behavior for Colab and only you will get access to your files, nothing is shared with us.\n",
        "5. Now the automatic installation and Download process starts, for most models in the TPU edition expect the loading to take between 15 and 30 minutes on average depending on the current Colab download speeds and the model you selected. These downloads happen trough Google's internet connection, you will not be billed by your internet provider and it will not count towards any download limits.\n",
        "6. After waiting a Trycloudflare link appears, click the link to enjoy KoboldAI. If you get a 1033 error Cloudflare is not done loading, in that case keep refreshing until it goes away. (If it keeps happening after 2 minutes Cloudflare has an issue, in that case you can use Runtime -> Restart and Run All to get a new link).\n",
        "7. As you play KoboldAI, keep this Colab tab open in the background and check occationally for Captcha's so they do not shut your instance down. If you do get shut down you can always download a copy of your gamesave in the Save menu inside KoboldAI. Stories are never lost as long as you keep KoboldAI open in your browser.\n",
