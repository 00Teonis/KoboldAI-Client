This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |\n",

It is focused on Novel style writing without the NSFW bias. While the name suggests a sci-fi model this model is designed for Novels of a variety of genre's. It is meant to be used in KoboldAI's regular mode. |\n",

If you seek a balance between a SFW Novel model and a NSFW model this model should be a good choice. |\n",

If Horni is to tame for you shinen might produce better results. While it is a Novel model it is unsuitable for SFW stories due to its heavy NSFW bias. Shinen will not hold back. It is meant to be used in KoboldAI's regular mode. |\n",

The end result is a very diverse model that is heavily biased towards SFW novel writing, but one that can go beyond its novel training and make for an excellent adventure model to. Adventure mode is best played from a second person perspective, but can be played in first or third person as well. Novel writing can be done best from the first or third person. |\n",

On top of that it also consists of light novel training further expanding its knowledge and writing capabilities. It can be used with the You filter bias if you wish to write Novels with it, but dedicated Novel models can perform better for this task. |\n",

It is exclusively for Adventure Mode and can take you on the epic and wackey adventures that AI Dungeon players love. It also features the many tropes of AI Dungeon as it has been trained on very similar data. It must be used in second person (You). |\n",

Creating a high quality model for your NSFW stories. This model is exclusively a novel model and is best used in third person. |\n",

The primary goal of the model is to provide improved performance and generalization when generating multi-turn dialogue for characters that were not present from within the fine tuning data. The prompted performance has especially improved over the predecessor model [C1-6B](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/c1-6B). |\n",

        "| Neo(X) by EleutherAI | 20B | Generic | NeoX is the largest EleutherAI model currently available, being a generic model it is not particularly trained towards anything and can do a variety of writing, Q&A and coding tasks. 20B's performance is closely compared to the 13B models and it is worth trying both especially if you have a task that does not involve english writing. Its behavior will be similar to the GPT-J-6B model since they are trained on the same dataset but with more sensitivity towards repetition penalty and with more knowledge. |\n",

This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger 20B model from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. |\n",

Being trained on the Pile and not biased towards anything in particular it is suitable for a variety of tasks such as writing, Q&A and coding tasks. You will likely get better result with larger generic models or finetuned models. |\n",

        "Using KoboldAI on Google Colab is easy! Simply follow these steps to get started:\n",
        "1. Mobile phone? Tap the play button below next to \"<--- Tap this if you play on mobile\" to reveal an audio player, play the silent audio to keep the tab alive so Google will not shut you down when your using KoboldAI. If no audio player is revealed your phone browser does not support Google Colab in the mobile view, go to your browser menu and enable Desktop mode before you continue.\n",
        "2. Select the model that most describes what you would like to do, by default we have the most recommended model for people willing to try out KoboldAI selected. If you are an advanced user you can also type any GPT model name from Huggingface.co to load this up (Unlisted Models may or may not work depending on Colab's hardware limitations).\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<--- Click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Allow Google Drive access, this typically happens trough a popup but sometimes Google Drive access may be requested trough the older method by asking you to click on a link and copy a code. This is normal behavior for Colab and only you will get access to your files, nothing is shared with us.\n",
        "5. Now the automatic installation and Download process starts, for most models in the GPU edition expect this to take 7 minutes on average depending on the current Colab download speeds. These downloads happen trough Google's internet connection, you will not be billed by your internet provider and it will not count towards any download limits.\n",
        "6. After waiting a Trycloudflare link appears, click the link to enjoy KoboldAI. If you get a 1033 error Cloudflare is not done loading, in that case keep refreshing until it goes away. (If it keeps happening after 2 minutes Cloudflare has an issue, in that case you can use Runtime -> Restart and Run All to get a new link).\n",
        "7. As you play KoboldAI, keep this Colab tab open in the background and check occationally for Captcha's so they do not shut your instance down. If you do get shut down you can always download a copy of your gamesave in the Save menu inside KoboldAI. Stories are never lost as long as you keep KoboldAI open in your browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get a error message saying you do not have access to a GPU/TPU instance? Do not continue and try again later, KoboldAI will not run correctly without them."
